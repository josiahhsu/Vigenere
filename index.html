    <h2>Using the Vigenère Cipher</h2>
    <p>
        The Vigenère cipher is a basic substitution cipher that shifts the characters of the original plaintext using a key.
        This key is an alphabetic character sequence where each character represents a shift amount (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).
        Each character in the plaintext corresponds to a character in the key based on its sequential position.
        If the plaintext is longer than the key, the key's sequential position wraps around to the beginning, effectively replicating the key until it's large enough to encipher the whole message.
        Messages are enciphered by shifting each plaintext character to the right by the amount determined by the corresponding key character.
        Likewise, deciphering a message simply uses the same key to shift characters in the opposite direction.
        Note that since this cipher is alphabetic in nature, it does not handle numeric or special characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site lets you either encipher or decipher a message with a given key.
        Enter the plaintext or ciphertext into the respective box alongside the key to be used, then click "Encipher" or "Decipher".
        The key itself must be purely alphabetic, but the messages are allowed to contain numeric or special characters.
        They will simply be ignored during the enciphering/deciphering process.

    <h2>Cracking the Vigenère Cipher</h2>
    <p>
        While the Vigenère cipher was once thought to be uncrackable, modern cryptanalysis can break the cipher fairly easily.
        Since the key replicates itself to match the length of the plaintext, shift amounts will occur in fixed intervals.
        Consequently, the key can be determined by using character frequency analysis on the slices of the ciphertext that have the same shift amounts.
        Even if the length of the key isn't known, this analysis can be repeated on various interval lengths to find the most likely key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although character frequency analysis is effective, its probabilistic nature means it's not infallible.
        Longer keys will diminish the effectiveness of this method by reducing the amount of key repetition during the enciphering process.
        Keys that are longer than half the size of the original plaintext will have portions that aren't repeated when enciphering.
        The corresponding portions of the ciphertext therefore cannot be determind with character frequency analysis.
        In the case where the key length is greater than or equal to the plaintext length, there will be no key repetition at all and character frequency analysis on the resulting ciphertext will fail completely.
        This special case is known as a one-time pad, and it can provide perfect security as long as the key is not reused.

        To decode a ciphertext, enter it below and click "Find key" to analyze the text.
        The most probable key and its corresponding deciphered text will be displayed below.
        For performance reasons, minimum and maximum key lengths can be specified to narrow the range of analysis.
        By default, the minimum key length will be 1 and the maximum key length will be half the size of the ciphertext.
